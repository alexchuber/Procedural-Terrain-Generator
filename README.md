# Procedural-Terrain-Generator
I made this as part of my digital arts & sciences class. To generate terrain algorithmically, the app reads pixel data from a heightmap-- a greyscale image depicting an aerial view of the terrain.
Lighter areas of the heightmap represent higher elevations; darker parts represent lower. So, the brightness of a pixel in a heightmap corresponds to some vertex's elevation in the 3D terrain. 

This project was made with Processing, a free graphical library and IDE that uses Java.\
If you'd like to run it for yourself...\
-Be sure to rename the root folder to Project4\
-Add images you'd like to use as heightmaps into /data (I've provided a few samples in the folder)\
-While running, update the "File Name" field to read a specific heightmap from /data
