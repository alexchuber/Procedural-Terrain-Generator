# Procedural-Terrain-Generator
Made Fall 2021

I made this as part of my digital arts & sciences class. The terrain is generated algorithmically by reading pixel data from a heightmap, a greyscale image showing an aerial view of the terrain. Lighter areas of the heightmap represent higher elevations; darker parts represent lower. So, the brightness of a pixel in the heightmap corresponds to some vertex's elevation in the 3D terrain.

This project was made with Processing, a free graphical library and IDE that uses Java.\
If you'd like to run it for yourself...\
-Be sure to rename the root folder to Project4\
-Add images you'd like to use as heightmaps into /data (I've provided a few samples in the folder)\
-While running, update the "File Name" field to read a specific heightmap from /data
